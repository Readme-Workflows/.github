# Readme-Workflows

Readme-Workflows is home of GitHub-Actions, but also Services and templates that you can use on your README files.

## Actions

We currently offer the following Actions:

- ### [recent-activity]
  Display your most recent activity in your README or any other markdown file.  
  The GitHub Action allows high customization to set what should be displayed and how.
- ### [readme-replacer]
  A simple, yet powerful GitHub Action that allows you to replace custom placeholders with specific values.  
  The Action even allows to evaluate the replacement using JavaScript to return dynamically changing values such as Dates.

## Templates

The following Repository-Templates can be used:

- ### [activity-template]
  Simple template to create a (Profile) README with the latest activity using the [recent-activity](#recent-activity) action.

## Other Services

We also provide the following services for your convenience:

- ### [Readme-Icon][readme-icons]
  Currated list of SVG icons and Gifs that can be used in your README file, or any other Markdown file.  
  Our [readme-replacer](#readme-replacer) action has direct support for the icons by providing a [collection of placeholders][placeholders] for it.
